Spotify Clone - OOP-based Media Streaming Service
A robust and modular media streaming application developed in C++ that showcases core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project mimics basic functionality of Spotify, including user management, playlists, songs, and subscription handling.

Features
Core Functionalities
User Management: Users can create, modify, and manage playlists.
Playlists:
Create and organize playlists.
Add, remove, and list songs in playlists.
Songs:
Search and play songs by title, artist, or genre.
Recently played songs tracking.
Subscription:
Free users experience ads and limited functionality.
Premium users get ad-free playback and offline downloads.
Design Patterns and OOP Concepts
Composition:
Playlists contain songs.
Users manage playlists and subscriptions.
Strategy Pattern:
Different algorithms for free vs. premium user experience.
Observer Pattern:
Notify users of new releases.
Inheritance:
Separate classes for Free and Premium users derived from a common base class.
